Emacs Pin Status - Show comprehensive Emacs pinning status

This command provides a complete overview of your Emacs pinning state,
including:
  - Current overlay commit (what's available)
  - Pinned commit (what you're locked to, if any)
  - Stored hash (SRI hash for the pinned commit)
  - Stored build path (Nix store path for reuse)
  - Current installed Emacs version

Usage:
    emacs-pin-status

Output when pinned:
  üìà Current overlay emacs-git commit: abc123...
  üîó View current: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/commit/abc123...

  üìå emacs-git is pinned to commit: def456...
  üîó View pinned: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/commit/def456...
  ‚úÖ Pin matches current overlay commit
    OR
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Pin differs from current overlay commit
     Run: emacs-pin (without arguments) to pin to current overlay commit
     Run: emacs-unpin to use latest overlay commit

  üîë Stored hash (SRI): sha256-xyz789...
  üì¶ Stored build path: /nix/store/abc-emacs-git-with-packages

  Current emacs version:
  GNU Emacs 31.0.50 (build 1, aarch64-apple-darwin...)

Output when not pinned:
  üìà Current overlay emacs-git commit: abc123...
  üîó View current: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/commit/abc123...

  üîì emacs-git is not pinned (using latest from overlay)
     Run: emacs-pin (without arguments) to pin to current overlay commit

Understanding the output:
  - Current overlay commit: Latest from emacs-overlay (updates with flake)
  - Pinned commit: Your locked version (prevents rebuilds on overlay updates)
  - Stored hash: Used by Nix to fetch the exact source
  - Stored build path: If present, `ns` reuses this (no rebuild)

What "stored build path not found" means:
  The pin files exist, but the built Emacs was garbage collected.
  The next `ns` will build the latest overlay commit (not the pinned commit)
  and auto-pin to it. This is intentional behavior to avoid building
  outdated versions that aren't available in substituters.

Design Philosophy:
  This command is the primary way to understand your Emacs pinning state.
  Use it frequently to verify:
    - You're pinned when you think you are
    - The stored path is present (no rebuild needed)
    - Your pin matches or differs from the latest
