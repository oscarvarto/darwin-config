*** My current Doom Emacs configuration in elisp at ~/.doom.d implements a lazy loading mechanism to avoid loading all my configuration at Emacs startup. It should, however, load the corresponding configuration files when certain functionality is needed. For example, at the moment, I need to evaluate the corresponding configuration file (e.g. ~/.doom.d/config/misc/my-mu4e-config.el) before using that. This is not as intended. Could you suggest a fix for the lazy loading mechanism, so that it loads the configuration when needed, and not before?

Okay, the user has this Doom Emacs setup with some lazy loading in place. Right now, they're facing an issue where certain configurations aren't loading automatically when needed. Instead, they have to manually evaluate the config files every time they want to use a feature like mu4e. That's definitely not ideal because it disrupts their workflow.

So, I need to figure out why this is happening. Maybe their current lazy loading setup isn't correctly detecting when certain packages or modes are called upon. In Emacs, especially with Doom, package initialization and autoloads play a big role here.

I remember that Emacs has this autoload mechanism where functions and variables can be loaded on-demand. If the user's config doesn't properly set up autoloads for the specific functions related to mu4e or other packages, those configs won't load when the package is first used. That would explain why they have to manually evaluate the files each time.

Looking at their example with mu4e, perhaps the issue is that the configuration file isn't being autoloaded when mu4e is started. So, I should suggest adding an autoload cookie to functions or variables in their config that are related to starting mu4e. That way, when they run a command like 'mu4e' for the first time, Emacs automatically loads the necessary configuration.

Alternatively, if the user prefers not to use autoloads, another approach is to hook the loading of their custom configurations into existing hooks provided by packages like mu4e. For example, adding a hook that runs when mu4e starts up and then loads their config file. This ensures that the configuration is loaded right when it's needed without having to do it manually.

I should also check if Doom has any specific recommended practices for lazy loading configurations. Maybe there are built-in functions or methods in Doom that handle this more elegantly. But given the current setup, using autoloads or hooks seems like a straightforward solution.

So, putting it all together, the user needs to modify their configuration files to include autoload directives where necessary. This way, when they first use a feature like mu4e, Emacs will automatically load the corresponding config file without any manual intervention. Alternatively, setting up hooks within those packages can achieve a similar effect by triggering the load when the package initializes.

I should outline these steps clearly so the user can implement them and test if it resolves their issue.

This sounds like an autoload issue in your custom configuration. When you define functionality that depends on certain packages or modes, you'll want to ensure that Emacs knows to load your configuration files when those packages are first used.

Here's a suggested fix:

#+begin_src elisp
;; In your ~/.doom.d/config/misc/my-mu4e-config.el file:
(defun my-mu4e-init ()
  "Initialize mu4e with custom settings."
  (interactive)
  ;; Your mu4e configuration here...
  )

;; Add an autoload directive at the top of the file if you plan to use this function interactively
;;;###autoload
(defun my-mu4e-init ()
  ...
)

;; Or, better yet, add a hook in your config to load when mu4e starts:
(add-hook 'mu4e-startup-hook #'my-mu4e-config)
#+end_src

Alternatively, you could ensure that your configuration is loaded when the package is loaded:

#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'mu4e
  (load! "my-mu4e-config"))
#+end_src

This way, your custom mu4e configuration will be loaded automatically when =mu4e= is first required.

The general idea is to use Emacs's autoload mechanism or Doom's built-in facilities to defer loading of non-essential configurations until they're needed.

*** What is wrong with the following elisp?
(autoload 'my/proactive-load-mu4e-config "config/misc/my-mu4e-config" nil t)
I am getting the following error message:
