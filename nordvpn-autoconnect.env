# NordVPN Autoconnect Environment Configuration
# Source this file or set these environment variables in your shell profile
# or modify the LaunchAgent configuration directly in your nix configuration

# NOTE: Dedicated IP is now securely stored in 1Password Personal vault
# Item name: "NordVPN Dedicated IP"
# No need to set NORDVPN_DEDICATED_IP environment variable

# Optional: Skip VPN autoconnect entirely (set to "true" to disable)
export SKIP_VPN_AUTOCONNECT="false"

# Optional: Skip when GlobalProtect is active (set to "true" to prioritize GlobalProtect)
export GLOBALPROTECT_ACTIVE="false"

# Usage examples:
# 1. To disable VPN autoconnect temporarily:
#    export SKIP_VPN_AUTOCONNECT="true"

# 2. To enable when GlobalProtect is your primary VPN:
#    export GLOBALPROTECT_ACTIVE="true"

# 3. To test the script manually (ensure you're signed in to 1Password):
#    op signin  # if not already signed in
#    source nordvpn-autoconnect.env
#    ./nordvpn-autoconnect.sh

# 4. To update the dedicated IP in 1Password:
#    op item edit "NordVPN Dedicated IP" --vault="Personal" password="new.ip.address.here"

# Note: Changes to this file won't affect the LaunchAgent automatically.
# You need to modify the EnvironmentVariables section in your nix configuration
# and rebuild with 'ns' command.

# The dedicated IP is securely stored in 1Password and retrieved automatically.
# No sensitive information is stored in configuration files.
